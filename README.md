<h3 align='center'>Turning Social Media Content into NFTs via the Ethereum blockchain</h3>

## Outline

As far as our understanding of <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/nft/'>NFTs</a> goes, Non-Fungible Tokens are unique JSON files that can be used to describe digital assets. Really, we're talking about any type of content, as the DogeCoin meme NFT was <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/iconic-doge-meme-nft-breaks-records-selling-roughly-4-million-n1270161'>reportedly</a> traded for 4 million USD in June 2021.

NFTs are a collector's game, as they essentially archive the internet. Once put up on the <a href='https://ipfs.io'>IPFS network</a>, they become timeless.
What's more, the ease of reproduction of the assets they represent is not a bother to the market. In other words, the right of ownership outlined by an NFT over an asset is not destituted by the asset's digital nature. 

Assets to be minted into NFTs are abundent in social media. As individual Instragram posts & Youtube videos garner millions of likes and views, there is no doubt that social media content is memorable, valuable and thus, NFT worthy. 

One could sell its post as it does with an autograph. One other could auction an event's video to once more interact with its fanbase without the need to create additional content. 

Kollecto is a marketplace that allows NFT minting (creating) & trading based on social media content. It's intial scope targets Instagram & Youtube. The project bases itself on the Ethereum blockchain's smart contracts functionality and puts forward its own cryptocurrency: Koyn.

## Progress

### Frontend
The design has been conceived in Figma & has been coded using React JS. Snippets of the functional views of the web application can be found in the following section. UI views are currently static & are awaiting development of the Kollecto-API project to be brought to life. 

### External API Integration
The UI is currently capable to use the Youtube Data V3 API to log in an user & fetch metadata about its uploaded videos.
